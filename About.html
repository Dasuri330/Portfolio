                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>Hi everyone! I am Dexter Cabubas, 20 years old. I am an aspiring photographer, traveler, video producer,
                    and software engineer. I am currently studying at NU Fairview, taking a bachelor's degree in information
                    technology. Taking BSIT is not my first choice, my first choice was to become a doctor, but destiny
                    did not lead me there in my dreams. Maybe becoming a doctor is not for me, so that is why I'm here,
                    taking the BSIT program. At first, I didn't want to take this course, but as the years went by, I enjoyed
                    every time when I'm working on projects and coding. I want to become a software engineer or a cybersecurity
                    expert someday. But honestly, I'm scared for my future because in my current year, I'm having a hard
                    time with coding. My favorite programming language is <strong>JAVA.</strong></p>

                    <p class="my-hobbies">My hobbies are playing video games specifically first person shooter like Crossfire
                        or Valorant. I spent my time playing video games but not all the times, I play games when I have
                        free time or am bored. Aside from that, I am a business-minded person. I don't want to be a company
                        employee for the rest of my life. I'm planning to build my own IT company someday and collaborate
                        with other defense companies to enhance cybersecurity, modern technology, radio communication technology,
                        and many more. I can sing as well and I can play instruments like the guitar.</p>

                    <p class="context">I also have a band. The name of my band is "Wednesday Alley." 
                        Our band was formed in December 2022, the name of our band was not yet Wednesday Alley. 
                        In fact, it doesn't have a name. We decided to name our band Wednesday Alley because we only 
                        rehearse every Wednesday because we don't have school every Wednesday and because the street we 
                        rehearsed on is Alley 1. I also came up with the name of our band. The Wednesday alley is composed of five members. 
                        vocalist Gwayne Canta and I and our drummer Enryk, our lead guitarist Eggsy, our rhythm Jules Bumatay, 
                        or better known as Dom, and our bassist Carlo.</p>
